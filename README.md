# Everything Voice Recognition

Everything Voice Recognition (EVR) is (and seeks to be) an exhaustive source for information about voice recognition technology, focusing on the latest software available across major operating systems and platforms. The information here is meant to serve as a source of information, to improve accessibility and push voice recognition towards greater mainstream use. This collection of knowledge is for public use and may be used personally by anyone. Take a look below for more information about the applications, libraries, and utilities that we have catalogued.

We welcome anyone wishing to share more information on anything related to voice recognition technology to help us maintain this as an up-to-date source. Please update the [CONTRIBUTOR](CONTRIBUTOR) file if you make any modification to the repo. Modifications can be made through a "pull request". If you would like to make any suggestions or mention any correction feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/dustydingo/everything-voice-recognition/issues) as well.

For more information about our terms and conditions please check below.

## How can I use this?

This repo is meant for anyone looking to use voice recognition technology, whether it is for experimentation, development, accessibility, or just curiosity. You are welcome to explore the content and information contained here. Our information is organized based on a structure. Applications, utilities, and libraries are mentioned below. They have been linked to the respective folders for further information about how to use each of them. Please follow each link for more information about each package.

Please refer to the terms and conditions below for any further clarifications.

# Structuring of Information
EVR structures data based on a fixed hierarchy, dividing applications, utilities, and libraries in two sub folders as follows:

```
applications > (application name) > (application information)
utilities > (utility name) > (utility information)
libraries > (library name) > (library information)
```

Specific information about each item will include the following information, among other information:
1. Installation
2. Usage
3. Documentation
4. Additional Resources
5. Development Information

The above list is merely illustrative and not exhaustive. As our requirements change we will continue to expand the folders and information contained with respect to each application. We strongly encourage all users to explore any software that they are looking to use.

If there are any relationships between applications, utilities, or libraries they will be linked within each of these folders. Additionally, the applications, utilities, and libraries will be listed below with links directly to each folder. If any utility or library is linked to any specific platform, application, or package that will be specifically mentioned.

Any changes to any information needs to be in accordance with this structure.

Additionally, apart from the above there will be information about voice recognition and comparisons that will be linked directly from here to the respective files and folders.
